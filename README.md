After running the system_main.cpp, you'll see a welcome message and a menu with options:
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt (Use when the file is encrypted using Encrypt)
3. Secure++ Encrypt
4. Secure++ Decrypt (Use when the file is encrypted using Secure++ Encrypt)
5. Exit
Type the number corresponding to the action you want to perform and press Enter.

Encryption Process:
Encrypt: Select Option 1 and enter the name of the text file to encrypt (ensure it ends with .txt). Then, provide the keyword for encryption.
Secure++ Encrypt: Select Option 3, enter the text file name, then input a secure key followed by a second keyword for additional security.

Decryption Process:
Decrypt: Select Option 2, enter the name of the text file to decrypt (same as the encrypted file), and provide the keyword used during encryption.
Secure++ Decrypt: Select Option 4, enter the text file name, then input the secure key and the second keyword used during Secure++ encryption.

To exit the Software:
If you wish to close the program, simply select option 5 and press Enter.

Important Note:
Ensure that the text files you want to encrypt or decrypt are accessible and properly named with a .txt extension.
Remember your keywords and secure keys as they are essential for the encryption and decryption processes. Without them, you will not be able to decrypt your files.
